    intro: "The Costa del Sol, from the western coast of Estepona to Málaga city, has long been one of Europe’s most attractive regions, thanks to more than 3000 hours of sun per year, a gentle climate, kilometre upon kilometre of golden sand beaches, beautiful natural ports, rich history and deep influences from different cultures. Due to its infrastructure network, the region is the best starting position from where discover the treasures of Andalusia – such as Granada, Seville, Cordoba or Cadiz – while it is also home to astonishing landscapes, the famous ‘white villages’ (rich in traditions) and offers a wealth of possibilities for sports in its surroundings, from skiing in the eastern Sierra Nevada to surfing in the western Atlantic coast."
    malaga: "In the last decade Málaga has constantly been declared the best place to live in Spain and this is really no surprise as it is at heart an unspoilt city with a beautiful old town, newly refurbished promenade and wonderful museums and restaurants. It combines all the facilities and activities of a main city with the relaxed spirit of the Costa del Sol. Its airport, one of the most important of the country, lies just 8km outside the city limits and flights come and go from right across the world."
    golden_mile: "Located in the heart of the Costa del Sol, Marbella attracts a diverse variety of nationalities to its sandy shores, benefitting as it does from the micro-climate created by the near mountain range, which frames the seaside town and bestows it with mild temperatures in the winter and wonderfully warm, long summers. Quality has become its hallmark, so it is little surprise that the most exclusive neighbourhoods in Southern Europe, such as La Zagaleta and Marbella's Sierra Blanca, are located here."
